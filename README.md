**Assignment-1  Basic Data Cleaning and data modelling**

To ensure data accuracy and consistency, the following data cleaning tasks were performed using Power BI’s Power Query Editor:

a.Identifed and removed unncessary columns that did not contribute to the analysis.

b.Ensured that each column had the correct datatype.

c.Handled missing values/blanks by imputing or excluding incomplete record.

d.Checked for duplicate values to ensure integrity.
e.Corrected column headers in the dataset.
